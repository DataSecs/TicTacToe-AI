# TicTacToeAI

This is a simple AI for TicTacToe. There is no real challenge in constructing an AI for a game like TicTacToe. The purpose of this project was the binary encoding of the board and an as efficient as possible MiniMax. The algorithm is implemented with and without Alpha-Beta pruning.

Results with MiniMax on my machine:
